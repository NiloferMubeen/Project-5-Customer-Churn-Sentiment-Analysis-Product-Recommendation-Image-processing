# Image Processing: 
This step includes some processing of image file like Edge detection, Image Enhancing, rescaling, Color inversion, mirror image, finding mode, resolution
# Text Porcessing:
This step includes preprocessing of the input text(any), like punctuation removal, stop words removal, claculating polarity to analyse the sentiment and creation of word cloud
# Sentiment analysis:
Sentiment analysis on the Airlines reviews data set is done and model is created to analyse the future sentiment.(Text classification)
# Customer Churn Prediction:
Customer behaviour is analysed useing the given data set. Some preprocessing of the data (data cleaning) is done and customer conversion is predicted
# Product Recommendation :
E-Commerce data set is used to analyse the similarites between the customers and similar products are found using cosine similarity.
